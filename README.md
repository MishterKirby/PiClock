# PiClock

PiClock is a multi-function clock.... for the Raspberry Pi, developed in Python and Qt.
It aims to be a standalone start-up program for simple desk clock projects. 

Currently, only a digital clock has been implemented, but plans to add a media player and weather reports are being considered.
In early stages of development, not much works out of the box yet.
